House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.
Unfortunately, ned had his head chopped off.  He met the wrong end of an axe,
lost his head and is no more.  :( Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in,
but his story was only about to being, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY
NOT DIE! jk. he totally gets poisoned and turns blue and his eyes bug out  it's
GREAT.
